# ðŸ›  Requirements

This project needs the following:

Python 3.x (recommended 3.8 or higher)

Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)

datetime (built-in Python module, no extra install)

âœ… Since everything is built-in with Python, you donâ€™t need to install external packages.

# ðŸ“¥ How to Check Requirements

## 1. Check Python version

```python --version```


or

```python3 --version```

## 2. Verify Tkinter is installed

Run this in Python shell:
```python
import tkinter

print("Tkinter is working!")
```

If you get no error, Tkinter is installed.

If you get an error, install it manually:

1. Windows: Tkinter comes with Python (no extra steps).

2. Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):

```sudo apt-get install python3-tk```


3. MacOS: Tkinter is included in the official Python installer.
